- The top of Data.Blend has some explanation.
- Haddock documention should be written.
- Type signatures in the generated code should be generated
  (goal of no warning at compilation, even for generated code).
  There is a warning for import Data.ByteString (ByteString).
  The import is needed so I don't understand it.
  There are warnings for 'h' not used. To suppress them, code
  to know if a structure contains pointers is necessary.
- The generated code is specific to some endianness and pointer size.
- Nothing is done yet to share the data structures from different
  Blender version.
