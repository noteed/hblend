- The top of Data.Blend has some explanation.
- Haddock documention should be written.
- Type signatures in the generated code should be generated
  (goal of no warning at compilation, even for generated code).
  There is a warning for import Data.ByteString (ByteString).
  The import is need so I don't understand it.
  There are warning for 'h' not used. To suppress them, code
  know if a structure contains pointers is necessary.
